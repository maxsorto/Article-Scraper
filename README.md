# Article Scraper

In recent years a large amount of text mining studies carried out on news articles have surfaced. As the field of text mining continues to grow, so will the need for collecting large amounts of textual data to analyze. In cases where projects used a large corpus of news articles for their study, it was observed that there was no documented method of collecting news article textual data from news sources. This research project documents the development of a model for the automatic collection of news articles based on a specific topic and date range. The results presented are the system architecture of a working software prototype based on the Python programming language and other publicly available tools, as well as a demonstration of the tool working with The Washington Post and Reuters as news sources.
